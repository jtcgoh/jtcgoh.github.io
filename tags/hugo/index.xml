      <description>As part of my job, I coach and guide student consultants to work on interdisciplinary projects. From experience, I have found most consultants have strong technical skills to perform an analysis but lack various soft skills.</description>

      <description>Bravo, Trang! Your hard work has truly paid off.&#xA;In the literature of meta analysis, the assumption is that the measurements are taken in the same unit and scale. However, this is not the case in most articles, making systematic review tedious.</description>

      <description>I was thrilled to find this project. It is such a gem because we seldom find ourselves working with data from the linguistic studies. We often wonder what do they do measure and what can they measure.</description>
