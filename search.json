All the other rules are more or less elaborations of this rule #1.\nA habit of creating learning exhaust:\nWrite blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets. Speak at meetups and conferences. Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, they’re not public. Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams. Start a newsletter. Draw cartoons. Link Make Free Stuff The best growth hack is still to build something people enjoy, then attaching no strings to it. You’d be surprised how far that can get you.\nMake free stuff! The web is still for everyone.\nLink\nHow to hone your new superpower: teaching I learned early in my developer journey that teaching others is an effective way to quickly deepen my understanding of a new concept or technology. I’ve found that needing to articulate a particular concept to others causes me to revisit my assumptions and leads me to do additional research to fill any knowledge gaps.\nLink\nYour future self will thank you: Building your personal documentation. Developers can take a DRY approach to how they search for answers to questions they encounter multiple times. By relying on an internal database (or “second brain”) they can reduce their reliance on external search engines.\nLink\nBrag now, remember later: Document your accomplishments Given five minutes notice to summarize your recent professional and personal accomplishments and wins, how detailed would your response be? Would that be enough time for you to sufficiently capture some of the things you’re most proud of from the past few months or years?\nLink\nThe most successful developers share more than they take One of the questions I always ask successful bloggers is: what motivated you to start? The answer is always the same: I did it for myself. Whatever your work, you should embrace the philosophy of “public by default”.\nPublic-by-default means this: everytime you create something, learn something, or just notice something’s interesting, do it in public. This may seem daunting—writing blog posts, helping the community and transforming ideas from thoughts into words all takes time. But sharing is like a muscle, and by committing to a regular schedule, you become much more efficient. This consistency of volume is also key to reaping the benefits of sharing.\nTo truly embrace public-by-default, it’s not enough to share your successful projects and knowledge, but additionally to bring the humility to share your learning and failures.\nLink\n","description":"Articles about learning in public, brag document and free stuffs.","tags":["newsletter"],"title":"Collections No.1","uri":"/collections/2023/collections/"},{"content":" Chhibber, N., Goh, J., and Law, E.
